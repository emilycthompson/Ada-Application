####Graphic Designer | Art Director | Aspiring Developer  
I am a graphic designer and art director living and working in Bellingham, WA. I specialize in branding, catalogs, look books and packaging for outdoors oriented brands. Since 2012, I have worked as a contractor, freelance or independently with clients varying from in-house creative departments to ad agencies, from mom-and-pop businesses to multi-national corporations. I have carved a niche for myself by being an effective communicator, extremely organized, detail-oriented, creative and reliable.
